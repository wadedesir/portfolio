# Personal Portfolio
Decided to sit down this week and create a website. Came up with something original with a design of my own. Really glad how it came out. Take a look and if you have any feedback feel free to use the form on the site to leave it.

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript. Kept it very Vanilla

Really had to take some time initially to get my design down. I always have a notebook next to me as I'm working so to start I made a small sketch of what I wanted the whole site to look like. The final result you are seeing came from that. I had to do some optimizations with the shape of the profile picture and work with clip path to get the diamond shape.

HTML was simple, tried to make it clean so that I wouldn't have any trouble on my CSS.
