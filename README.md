# Personal Portfolio
Had to sit down this week and create something nice for me this time. Came up with something original with a design of my own. Really glad how it came out. Take a look and if you have any feedback feel free to use the form on the site to leave it.

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript. Kept it very Vanilla

Really had to take some time initially to get my design down. I always have a notebook next to me as I'm working so to start I made a small sketch of what I wanted the whole site to look like. The final result you are seeing came from that. I had to do some optimizations with the shape of the profile picture and work with clip path to get that looking how I want to. Still not sure if I want to change that to a circle.
